### Hey, I'm Colin.

I'm a software engineer, currently leading the Colliers USTI Visualization team. We build tools that help our brokers find the data they need to close deals. Before that, I spent time building apps for REscour, Inform, Sharecare, HowStuffWorks International, Arrayfire, among others.

When I'm not working on apps at Colliers you can find me rewriting my Vim configs, playing bluegrass banjo, and spending time with my family.
